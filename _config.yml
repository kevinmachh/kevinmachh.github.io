  I am interested in full-stack development along with understanding the basic needs of individuals 
  and progressing that forward by creating application and technology that will enrich their lives. 
  I hope to make video games that I will be educational while providing an entertaining factor. 
  I currently play games myself such as League of Legends, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
